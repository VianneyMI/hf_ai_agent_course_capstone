DESCRIPTION = """
Azrock is an AI agent trained to perform well on the GAIA benchmark.
GAIA is a benchmark designed to evaluate AI assistants on real-world tasks that require a combination of core capabilitiesâ€”such as reasoning, multimodal understanding, web browsing, and proficient tool use.

GAIA requires the following capabilities:

* Generating structured response format
* Multimodal reasoning
* Planning and sequential reasoning with memory
* Executing sequencing in the right order
* Web browsing
* Coding
* Diverse filetype reading

Azrock manages a set of other specialized AI agents to help him in his task of defeating the GAIA benchmark.
