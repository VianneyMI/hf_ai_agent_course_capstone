## Next Steps to improve the agent

* Provide an alternative web_search tool to act as a fallback when there is issue with the DuckDuckGoSearchTool. Cf Operation Timeout error
* Provide tools to read and analyze video.
* Add observability to check to analyze and debug.
* Save history of the run locally as well.
* Split the agent into multiple agents to handle different tasks.
* Do not try to run all 20 questions at once.
* Add a pause between 2 questions to avoid rate limiting.
